# Purpose
This branch will be used to create a scheduling feature on the aspc course selection. Through this students will be able to search for classes at specific times.

This will be accomplished through two small input bars which allow for "start time" and "end time" to be inputted. Classes between these times will appear once searched.
For example, if a student needs a class after 11am on Monday or Wednesday but before 1pm, the student can type "11" in the start time and "1" for the end time. 
After searching, the classes that appear will start on or after 11, but finish before 1pm.
