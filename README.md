# ASPC 2.0
This repo is intended to be a complete rewrite of aspc.pomona.edu (soon to be pomonastudents.org). The aim of this project is to: 
 - Put the content that most people use front and center
 - Redesign the website from the ground up
 - Streamline and trim legacy features

## Development
This repo is run and maintained by the ASPC Digital Media Group, but anyone may contribute to this repository! If you attend Pomona College or any of the other Claremont Colleges and would like to join, please feel free to reach out.

### Getting Up And Running
 1. Clone this repo
 2. Install [Vagrant and VMWare]()
 3. Run `vagrant provision` from inside the cloned directory. Follow the prompts, default options are fine. This will handle dependency installation and all that jazz. 
 4. Run `vagrant up`. You should now be able to navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and see a local copy of this website up and running! 

 _Note: Vagrant may seem magical/opaque and hard to understand, but for the purposes of facilitating development we've provded a quick summary over [containerization with Vagrant and VMWare]() should you be interested in learning more._
