# Core Technologies  

As an open-source project, this application would not be possible without the labor of countless others. We 
try to keep this file up-to-date with all of the tools and technologies we use as a small shout-out and to keep
track of what we're using and why.

## Core App Technologies

#### Ruby on Rails: Web Application Framework 

Server-side application framework written in Ruby which provides the major building-blocks for the ASPC website. Without 
Rails, this site would simply not be possible!

#### Bulma: CSS Framework

An amazing, modern frontend framework streamlines our UI work by providing customizable style templates.

#### Vagrant: Virtual Machine Manager

This command-line tool provisions and manages virtual machines, meaning that it can start, refresh, and stop the 
local environment that we use for development and ensure consistency across our many development machines and production
environment.

#### VirtualBox: Virtual Machine

The virtual machine managed by Vagrant which provides our developers a local environment where they can access 
their local version of the ASPC website and database in the same environment as the site running on production.


#### PostgresQL 

The database technology we use to persist our application data. 

#### Capistrano

Deployment tool responsible for releasing production-ready code to the public.

## Product Management Tools

#### Waffle: Task Manager 

Tracks and assigns tasks for our team.

#### Rollbar: Monitoring and Logging

Allows us to check error and usage logs to understand site failures and traffic. 

#### Uptime Robot: Server Status

Alerts us when one of our sites has crashed.
